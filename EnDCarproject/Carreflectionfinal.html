  This is a reflection about the process in making my 3D replica of a hot wheels pizza truck using a 3D printer. We used OnShape to transform the 2D profile drawings into a 3D rendering using the X, Y and Z planes.

<h3> Guidelines </h3>
<p> These are the guidelines for our project:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Car must be designed as an intersection of 3 forms for the X, Y, and Z planes</li>
  <li> Should be drawn in a 1:1 ratio</li>
  <li> Drawing may only be off in proportion size by 1% </li>
  <li> OnShape car creation exported in an STL format</li>
  <li> Use orientation feature in Cura to use least support material before 3D printing process </li>
  <li>File exported as a GCODE </li>
  <li> Final rendering exported as embedded STL into the HTML webpage </li>
</ul>
<h3> Project steps: </h3>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li>Make OnShape account and download Cura </li>
  <li>Select desired hot wheels car </li>
  <li>Create engineering drawing on graph paper

<h3> Process: </h3>
<p> 
The first step was to create the engineering drawing. Using calipers, I measured out the correct dimensions and drew a profile drawing from the front, back, and top of my car. I then uploaded that drawing to my computer, took screenshots of each position, and pasted them to the rectangular prism with the same dimensions as my car in OnShape.  To create the shape of the car, I used the pen tool to trace the drawings on each face of the prism, and extruded the negative and positive space. To add more detail, I focused on improving the front view of the pizza truck. I added a grill, headlights, and the two paned windshield. On the sides, I used the extrude tool to create the windows and the door. For the wheels,  I extruded them outwards to give them their shape. On the back of my car I added text that said “Lambtalk” which I thought was funny because that “saying” is attributed to a Lamborghini, not a pizza truck. Finally, I exported my design to Cura and created my object using the 3D printer. The last step was to take photos and add them to the slide deck. When finished, I also created my CAD drawing where I was asked to fill out some questions and calculate my margin of error in the size of the original truck and my replica.

<h3> Challenges, Setbacks, and Solutions </h3>
<p>
Overall, I felt as if the project went rather smooth with minimal error. The one area where I had an issue was with the text on the back of my car. I had extruded it 5 mm which was way too far, though, I thought it looked cool in the STL file. Thus, there was not enough support material on the underside of the text leading to it being illegible in the 3D print. To fix this, rather than making a whole new print, I filed the text away until there was nothing left. Although I did not have my text, I was still very pleased with how my pizza truck came out.
