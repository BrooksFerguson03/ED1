  This is a reflection about the process in making my 3D replica of a hot wheels pizza truck using a 3D printer. We used OnShape to transform the 2D profile drawings into a 3D rendering using the X, Y and Z planes.

<h3> Guidelines </h3>
<p> These are the guidelines for our project:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Car designed as an intersection of three forms</li>
  <li> Design car in a 1:1 ratio</li>
  <li> Size accuracy ±1% </li>
  <li> Design is exported as stl</li>
  <li> Student orients model in Cura for 3D printing to minimize support material </li>
  <li>File is exported as a gcode </li>
  <li> Final design is shared out as an embedded STL on an HTML webpage </li>
</ul>
<h3> Project steps: </h3>
<p> 
<ul>
  <li>Create Onshape account and download Cura </li>
  <li>Choose a toy model to replicate (Hot Wheels ice cream truck) </li>
  <li>Create an engineering drawing (draw the X, Y, and Z planes of your car)

<figcaption> (This is my beginning engineering drawing)</figcaption></li>
  <li>Scan or photograph your drawing and upload it to your computer</li>
  <li>Take screenshots of each plane 
 </li>
  <li>Go onto Onshape and create a rectangular prism with the same dimensions as your car </li>
  <li>Import the images on to the X, Y, and Z planes of the rectangular prism </li>
  <li>Use the pen tool to draw each profile on each plane side </li>
  <li>Use the extrusion tool to remove the negative space and form your 3D model </li>
  <li>Use the extrusion tool and fillet tool for finishing details  </li>
  <li>Export the STL file
 </li>
  <li>Import your design into Cura </li>
  <li>Make any final scaling changes (not recommended in instruction video)</li>
  <li>Position 3D model on the build plate to minimize support material </li>
  <li>Change the setting to a .6mm nozzle </li>
  <li>Export as a GCODE file </li>
  <li>Print model </li>
  
</ul>
</p>
<h3> The process: </h3>
<p> 
I started by drawing my car from the front, back, and side. Then, I uploaded it to my computer and made an Onshape account. Next, I made a rectangular prism with the same dimensions as my car, imported the screenshots of each side of my car, and pasted them on to each side.

<figcaption> (This is my car after I pasted the images onto the sides and used the pen tool on one side) </figcaption>


 I then used the pen tool to trace my drawings and used the extrusion tool to remove the negative space.

  I could have stopped there but I really wanted to add some more details. I added circles and lines for headlights and other details on the front. I added my name on the back. I added three windows and then I added texture to the top of the car along with the shapes that stuck out of the top of my hot wheels truck. Finally, I spent what felt like 100 hours on making details on the tire to make them look more realistic.

  I then imported my design into Cura and printed it. I also, with the help of Ms. Hedstrom, added stickers of pizza, flames, and chefs.

<h3> Challenges, Setbacks, How I Overcame </h3>
<p>
One challenge I faced was that the details on my car did not show up on the 3D printed model. This was extremely disappointing as I had spent a lot of time on the details — especially the tires. The only way to fix that problem would be having a nozzle that is smaller than .6 mm or to make my car a lot bigger so that the .6mm nozzle would be able to print those details.  Another challenge I faced was on the CAD drawing. I could not figure out how to get a front isometric view of my car.

<figcaption> (This is the problem I faced with the isometric view) </figcaption>


 I tried deleting my car and then re-pasting it into a different onshape drawing and nothing seemed to work. Luckily in class, someone taught me how to do it. All I had to do was hover over the edge of the side view until it gave me the option to put down a front isometric view.
